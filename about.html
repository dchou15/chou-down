      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I'm currently pursuing my MBA at Georgetown University with a background in data analytics, business strategy, and consulting. I've worked at EY and Kaiser Permanente and am passionate about solving real-world problems through creative, data-backed solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of work, I enjoy soccer, fantasy sports, traveling (40+ countries), and learning about innovative technologies and business models.
      </p>
      <p>
        My goal is to bridge the gap between strategic thinking and analytical executionâ€”helping companies not just make decisions, but make the right ones.
